}
```

### **🎯 Usage Examples**

1. **Planning Your Day**
   - Add blocks for each major task
   - Include break periods
   - Set meeting times
   - Drag to adjust order

2. **Time Blocking Best Practices**
   - Block similar tasks together
   - Include buffer time between blocks
   - Color-code by energy level or priority
   - Review and adjust as needed

This implementation provides a complete time-blocking system that integrates seamlessly with Cal Newport's multi-scale planning methodology, allowing users to structure their days effectively while maintaining flexibility through drag-and-drop reordering.
